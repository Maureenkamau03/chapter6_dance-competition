>Before you start the lesson, it is important to carry out an ice-breaker. An ice-breaker is a simple activity meant to ease entry into a session. Search online for a handful of short ice-breakers.
>
> Once all students have settled, you are ready to start the lesson. Introduce this lesson by asking them questions such as:
>
> - What did we learn in our previous class? (Wait for an answer or assess the response)

In our previous class, we created a project about ourselves.

> [Teacher's notes] Student engagement
>
> Engage the students with such a question:
>
> - What was the project about?
> - What blocks did we use?
>
> You can ask them what each of the blocks do, or mention a functionality and ask which block does that. You can do both interchangeably.
> 

The project contained sprites representing the different things we like. Once the sprite was clicked it said something about the specific thing we like.

>After doing a recap of the previous class, you can ask such questions as:
>
> - How many of you know what we are going to learn in this class? (Wait for an answer or assess the response)
> - Based on the title of our project, what do you think we are going to do today?
> 
> As a teacher, be sure to encourage your students to feel free to answer.
>

In our lesson today, we’re stepping into the spotlight of an exciting dance competition! Imagine a stage filled with colorful lights, music pumping, and dancers showing off their best moves. And guess what? You’re going to be the directors of this spectacular show! We're going to create our own virtual dance competition, complete with contestants, an emcee, and applause. Are you ready to bring the dancers to life and crown the champion of the dance floor?

> [Teacher's notes] Student Engagement
>
> Throughout the project encourage creativity and experimentation.
>
> Provide one-on-one assistance when needed, but also encourage peer learning and collaboration.
>
> You can engage the students by asking them:
>
> You can engage the students by asking them:

[Dance competition project link](#https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1072985225)


> [Teacher's notes] Student Engagement
>
> You can run this project so that all students see what is going on. You can also allow one or two students to come to the front and test it out on their own.

Let us take some time to think through the project.

### Step 1: Resources

What resources do you think you will need for this project? In your notebook, let us write down all the resources you will need:

- Sprites
- Backdrops
- Sounds

> [Teacher's notes] Confirm
>
> Ensure that all students write down what they think they will need. You can move around to check that they are doing so.
>
> They should write:
> - Today's date
> - The project's title: **DANCE COMPETITION** in capital letters
> - The sub-title: _Plan_
> - The subsection: _Step 1: Resources Needed_

### Step 2: Project Flow

In this step, we are going to think about how the project works. When we talk of _project flow_ we mean _what happens as soon as the Green Flag is clicked_. Let us think about it together. 

> [Teacher's notes] 
>
> Run the project on the tv. Allow them to observe what happens when the green flag is clicked.
>

What do you observe when the teacher clicks on the green flag?

> [Teacher's notes] 
>
> In case you notice that they are not able to make an observation, you can make the first one then they pick it up from there.
>
> For the very young ones, you can just let them raise their hands and state their observations. This is because it might take them too long to write down.

In your notebook, you need to write down the flow of events immediately after the Green Flag is clicked. How would you write this in your notebook?

- Add a sub-section called _Step 2: Project Flow_
- Write :
    1. Immediately after the Green Flag is clicked, the emcee welcomes the audience to the competition.
    2. The emcee welcomes the first contestant.
    3. The emcee asks the audience to applaud the first dancer when he finishes dancing.
    4. The emcee welcomes the second contestant.
    5. The emcee asks the audience to applaud the second dancer when she finishes dancing.
    6. The emcee announces the winner.

Add more observations to the list.

> [Teacher's notes] Student Engagement
>
> Keep running the project on the TV screen so the students can follow along as they make their observations. 
>
> Ensure that all students write down their observations. You can move around to check that they are doing so.
>

### Step 3: Blocks Needed

What blocks do you think may be useful for you to complete this project? Write down what you will need.

> [Teacher's notes] Confirm
>
> Ensure that all students write down what they think they will need. You can move around to check that they are doing so.
>
>For this class, they are still not well conversant with Scratch, therefore are not well aware of the blocks. Let them make wild guesses.
> They should write:
> - The subsection: _Step 3: Blocks Needed_

> For the very young ones, you can just let them raise their hands and state the the blocks they think they will need. This is because it might take them too long to write down.

## Create

With a good understanding of the project that we are building for this lesson, we can now proceed to creating the project.

> [Teacher's notes] Student Engagement
>
> - Show them how to open Scratch.
>
> - Show them how to create a new project.
>
> - Show them how to rename their project. This is the formart of the project name: _projectname - student's name_ for example _dance competition - Maureen_
>
### Step 1: Create a new project
Create a new project and rename your project to _dance competition - _your name_. 

### Step 2: Delete the cat sprite

> [Teacher's notes] Student Engagement
> You can ask: Is the cat part of the dancing competition?

There is a cat sprite that appears by default whenever you create a new project. Is the cat part of the dance competition? 

To delete a sprite in Scratch, click on the trash icon on the top right corner of the sprite in the sprite area. This is shown below:

![Delete cat sprite](/images/chapter6/chapter6_delete_cat_sprite.png)

### Step 3: Add a backdrop

> [Teacher's notes] Student Engagement
>
> Ask one of them to come show the rest where we can find a backdrop. (Wait for response)
>
The first thing we need to add is a backdrop. Do you remember what a backdrop is? To get a backdrop, first click on the button to choose a backdrop.

![Button to choose a backdrop](/images/chapter6/chapter6_choose_backdrop.png)

After clicking that button, you will see a variety of backdrops. For this project, we are specifically going to make use of the 'spotlight' backdrop. To easily get an the backdrop, click on the click on search and type in 'spotlight' as shown below:

![Search a backdrop](/images/chapter6/chapter6_backdrop.png)

Then click on the backdrop to select it. Your stage should now look like this:

![Search a backdrop](/images/chapter6/chapter6_stage.png)

> [Teacher's note]
>
> Walk around to ensure that the students add their backdrops.

With the backdrop successfully added, we will now proceed to add the sprites required for our project.

### Step 4: Add sprites

As we planned for the project, we identified all the sprites that we needed for this project.

> [Teacher's notes] Student Engagement
>
> Ask them to mention the sprites we need. Let them raise their hands and wait for their turn to answer. (Wait for response)
>
Let's add these sprites to our project. Do you remember how to add a sprite?

> [Teacher's notes] Student Engagement
>
> Ask one of them to come show the rest how they can add a sprite. (Wait for response)
>

Click on the button to choose a sprite as shown below.

![Button to choose sprite](/images/chapter6/chapter6_btn_sprite.png)

Search for the specific sprite you want. I am going to start with champ99.

![Search sprite](/images/chapter6/chapter6_search_sprite.png)

Click on the sprite to select it.

Repeat the process for anina dance and marian. Your project should look like the one shown below.

![All sprites](/images/chapter6/chapter6_all_sprites.png)

Good job for coming this far!

With all the sprites added, let's let us reduce the sizes of Champ99 and Anina dance to **80**. Click on Champ99.

![Change sprite size](/images/chapter6/chapter6_change_size.png)

Reapeat the same for Anina dance. Do not change the size of Marian.

### Step 5: Coding

Fantastic work so far, everyone! Now that we’ve set the stage with our ideas and characters, it’s time to make the competition come alive by adding some code. Let’s get creative and bring our dancers to life with movement, music, and energy as we take our project to the next level!

#### Step 1: Backdrop

We will start with the backdrop. What happens to the backdrop when the green flag is clicked?

> [Teacher's note]
>
> It is recommended that you run the project again on the tv and let them observe. Do this as many times as there need be. 
> Wait for responses. The goal is to have them make indepedent observations.
>
> They might not be able to make this observation since nothing visible happens to the backdrop. Just state it for them.

- It plays a song forever.
- It changes colors forever.

##### When the Green flag is clicked

Add, _when Green Flag Clicked_ block, found in events. Drag and drop it to the coding area. Make sure that the stage is selected so that you don't add your code to the wrong resource.

![Green flag clicked](/images/chapter6/chapter6_green_flag.png)

We want our song to play forever, therefore, let us add the forever block.

![Forever block](/images/chapter6/chapter6_forever_block.png)

To get a sound, these are the steps we are going to follow:

- Click on sounds

![Click sounds](/images/chapter6/chapter6_click_sounds.png)

- Delete the pop sound

![Delete pop sound](/images/chapter6/chapter6_delete_pop.png)

- Click on the sound button to choose a sound

![Button to choose sound](/images/chapter6/chapter6_btn_to_choose_sound.png)

- List of sounds

![All sounds](/images/chapter6/chapter6_sound_list.png)

- Search sound

![All sounds](/images/chapter6/chapter6_search_sound.png)

Once you get the sound, select it by clicking on it.

![Selected sound](/images/chapter6/chapter6_selected_sound.png)

- Click on code to go back to the code area

![Go back to code](/images/chapter6/chapter6_click_code.png)

- Select the sound pallet

![Sound pallet](/images/chapter6/chapter6_sound_pallete.png)

- Drag and drop _play sound_ block to the coding area.

![Play sound block](/images/chapter6/chapter6_sound.png)

Click on the green flag to test your code. Does the sound play forever?

On our project shown above, we observed that the stage also keeps changing color. What blocks can we use to achieve this? You are right! We will make use of the ***when green flag clicked***, ***forever***, and ***change color effect*** blocks.  We find *change color effect* block in looks.  

Update your code as folows:

![Change color](/images/chapter6/chapter6_change_color.png)

Click on the green flag to test your script. What do you observe? You should hear a some music play forever as well as observe the stage change color forever.
> [Teacher's note] Confirm
>
> Walk around to check that the students have achieved this.
>
> This is the end of part one. However, if the students get to this point before the end of the class, feel free to proceed to the part 2.
>

Well done for coming this far! We are going to pause our project at that point. Are you excited to make our project more fun by adding code to our other resources? We will catch up on that in our next class.

> [Teacher's notes]Wrap up
>
>Ask them whether they have any questions before you end the class.
>
> Ensure that each student's work is saved.
>
> Once saved, they can close the Scratch app.
>
> Guide the students to exit the room in an orderly manner.

#### Step 2: Marian

We are now goinng to start adding code to our sprites, starting with Marian, our emcee. What happens to Marian Immediately the green flag is clicked?


> [Teacher's notes] Student Engagement
>
> Run the project again and let them observe. Ask them if they have an idea on how to do this. (Wait for responses).
>
> Remember to congratulate them. There is no right or wrong answer.
>

- She switches different costume
- She welcomes the audience
- She switches to a different costume
- She welcomes the first contestant
- She switches to a different costume

Let us add code to Marian to bring these actions to life. Click on Marian so that you do not add the code to the wrong resource. To make Marian switch to different costumes, we are going to make use of a new block called **switch costume to**. If you click on costumes, you will be able to see the different costumes that Marian has. 

![Marian costumes](/images/chapter6/chapter6_marian_costumes.png)

Update Marian's script as shown below.

![Marian script](/images/chapter6/chapter6_marian_intro.mp4)

![Marian script](/images/chapter6/chapter6_marian_intro_script.gif)

Here is a summary of the script.

![Marian script](/images/chapter6/chapter6_marian_intro_script.png)


From our project, what happens when the emcee, introduces the first contestant? 
You are right! The first contestant starts dancing. How does the contestant know that they have been introduced and should now start dancing? We are going to introduce ourselves to a new block called **broadcast** block.

> [Teacher's notes]
>
>Let them write about the broadcast block. The notes are as below
>
To broadcast means to send out a message.

The broadcast block in Scratch is used to send a message that triggers actions in other sprites or scripts. It allows sprites or scripts to communicate with each other without being directly connected. 

The broadcast block goes hand in hand with the **when I receive** block. This blocks enables a sprite to do something when they receive a message from another sprite.

Let us update Marian's script with the ***broacast block*** to send a message to champ99 that he should start dancing.

The broadcast block is found on the events pallete.

![Broadcast](/images/chapter6/chapter6_broadcast_block.png)

Click on the dropdown arrow to create a new message as shown below.

![Broadcast](/images/chapter6/chapter6_start_dance_broadacast.mp4)
![Broadcast](/images/chapter6/chapter6_broadcast.gif)

#### Step 3: Champ99

Now that Marian has sent out a message to start dancing, this message can be received by champ99 so that he can start dancing. We use the 
***when i receive block*** block to enable our sprite respond to the message sent. This block is also found in the events block. 

Click on Champ99 and update his script as shown below.

![Champ99 dance](/images/chapter6/chapter6_champ99.gif)

Below is the script.

![Champ99 dance](/images/chapter6/chapter6_champ99.png)

Click on the green flag to test your code. What do you observe?

Let us review our project once again.  What happens when champ99 finishes dancing?

> [Teacher's notes]
>
>Run the project again
>

- Marian asks the audience to clap for Champ99
- A sound of people clapping is heard.
- She switches to a different costume
- She welcomes Anina to start dancing

For us to enable Marian tell when Champ99 has finished dancing, Champ99 has to send a message that he has finished dancing. Le us add the broadcast block to send this message out as shown below.

![Champ99 finished dancing](/images/chapter6/chapter6_finished_dancing_champ99.gif)

Below is the script

![Champ99 dance](/images/chapter6/chapter6_champ99_broadcast.png)

#### Step 4: Marian
How will Marian respond to this message?

Update Marian's code as shown below. MAke sure that you have clicked on Marian to avoid adding code to the wrong sprite.

![Clapping for chanp99](/images/chapter6/chapterr6_clapping_champ99.gif)

Below is the script

![Clapping for chanp99](/images/chapter6/chapter6_clapping_for_champ99.png)

Click on the green flag to test your code. What do yu observe?

Our competiton is now 80% done, with Anina as our last contestant. Let us welcome Anina to the floor. Update Marian's script to welcome Anina as shown below.

![Clapping for champ99](/images/chapter6/chapter6_welcome_anina.png)

we have sent out a message to Anina so that she can start dancing.

#### Step 5: Anina Dance
Let us add Anina's script. Click on Anina. There is no code for her just yet. 

![Clapping for champ99](/images/chapter6/chapter6_anina_dance.png)
